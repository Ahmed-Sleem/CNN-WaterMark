# CNN-WaterMark

A framework for embedding verifiable ownership watermarks into CNN architectures, enabling model authentication and intellectual property protection.

## Components

- **Fixed Weight Watermarking** (`fixed-weights-cnn-watermark.ipynb`)
- **Comparative Methods Analysis** (`cnn-watermark-comparing-methods.ipynb`) 
- **Comprehensive evaluation** metrics and visualizations

## Key Features
- **Verifiable model ownership through weight-based watermarks**
- **Minimal performance impact on model accuracy**
- **Robust watermark detection and verification**
- **Comprehensive evaluation metrics and visualizations**
